## What it does

Writers can upload their books and get a generated NFT that represents this book.
The app enables writers to receive immediate returns on their work, there’s no issue of gaining a bit of popularity first, as long as your book is on our site and the users like it, you’ll get paid for your efforts. The users aren’t charged anything, instead the writer can set a price for the chapters of their book and receive tokens directly from the reader without an intermediary.

## Inspiration

I read a lot of web novels and fanfiction, and sites like Wuxiaworld, Wattpad and Webnovel already do a good job with e libraries like these but the major issue I noticed is that an author has to reach a certain stage or level before they can monetize their work on these sites, I believe there are reasons for that and I know web3 can fix that problem.

## How I built it

- I used the powerful features of Next.js,
- I built the Frontend using Next.js and materialUi, and authentication with Next auth and the Moralis SDK. For smart contract integration I used ethers and Moralis SDK.
- I used firebase for the database and web3.storage for storing data and generating a URL for uploaded files to save with the NFT.

## Challenges I ran into

At the beginning I found it very hard to get started due to a lack of a design to follow and working on this myself.
I had to make considerations on the database schema and how best to store files while ensuring security and making retrieving data easier.

## What I learned

This was a solo project and I had to work on everything myself, I learnt so much about design, the right places to get inspiration from and even a thing or two about the basics of UI design with Figma.
I greatly improved my understanding of firebase and ethers.js.
Using Next.js on this project was an eye opener, I used great features I had not taken the time to learn like Next auth while getting to understand a bit more about how helpful Moralis can be.

## What's next for Prime Books

There are major updates coming up for Prime Books, I will be finding ways to reduce how many transactions a user has to go through while maximizing the profits of our writers.
There will be some UI upgrades, I'll be bringing in a UI designer to help with touching up the app.
